Submitting Bug Reports or Feature Requests
********************************************************************************

If you find a bug in |pbm|, you can submit a report to the `JIRA issue tracker`_
for |pbm|.

Start by searching the open tickets for a similar report. If you find that
someone else has already reported your problem, then you can upvote that report
to increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report following these steps:

1. Sign in to `JIRA issue tracker`_. You will need to create an account if you
   do not have one.
#. In the *Summary*, *Description*, *Steps To Reproduce*, *Affects Version* fields
   describe the problem you have detected. For PBM the important diagnostic
   information is: log files from the pbm-agents; a dump of the
   PBM control collections.
  
As a general rule of thumb, try to create bug reports that are:

- *Reproducible*: describe the steps to reproduce the problem.
- *Specific*: include the version of |pbm|, your environment, and so on.
- *Unique*: check if there already exists a JIRA ticket to describe
  the problem.
- *Scoped to a Single Bug*: only report one bug in one JIRA ticket.
