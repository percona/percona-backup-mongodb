|pbm| Documentation
********************************************************************************

|pbm| is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of
|mongodb| sharded clusters and replica sets.

|pbm| supports `Percona Server for MongoDB
<https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb>`_
and MongoDB Community v3.6 or higher with `MongoDB Replication
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/>`_ enabled.

.. note:: 

   The |pbm| project was inspired by (and intends to replace)
   `mongodb_consistent_backup`. This tool is not supported any longer.

.. rubric:: How to use |pbm|: going back in time (|pbm-restore|)

In a highly-available architecture, such as |mongodb| replication, there is no
need to make a backup in order to recover from a problem like a disk failure. If
you lose one node you can replace it by re-initializing from one of its replica
set peers.

*The only point of backups of a replica set is to go back in time*. For example,
a web application update was released on *Sunday, June 9th 23:00 EST* but, by
11:23 Monday, someone realizes that the update has wiped the historical data of
any user who logged in due to a bug.

Nobody likes to have downtime, but it's time to roll back: what's the best backup
to use?

The most recent daily backup would include 4 hours of damage caused by the bug.
Let's restore the one before that:

.. include:: .res/code-block/bash/pbm-restore-mongodb-uri.txt

Next time there is an application release, it might be best to make an extra backup
manually just before:

.. include:: .res/code-block/bash/pbm-backup-mongodb-uri.txt
