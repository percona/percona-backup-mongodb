|pbm| Documentation
********************************************************************************

|pbm| is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of
|mongodb| sharded clusters and replica sets.

|pbm| supports `Percona Server for MongoDB
<https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb>`_
and MongoDB Community v3.6 or higher with `MongoDB Replication
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/>`_ enabled.

The |pbm| project inherited from and replaces `mongodb_consistent_backup`,
which is no longer actively developed or supported.

   - Backup and restore for both classic, non-sharded replicasets and clusters
   - Simple command-line management utility
   - Oplog capture that provides data consistency for any replica set
   - Oplog capture synchronization in cluster backups provides cross-cluster
     consistency.
   - Simple, integrated-with-MongoDB authentication
   - No need to install a coordination service on a separate server.
   - Use any S3-compatible storage
   - Users with classic, locally-mounted remote filesystem backup servers can
     use 'filesystem' instead of 's3' storage type.
