|percona| provides and supports installation packages for |pbm| in the *deb* and
*rpm* formats that you can install by using ``apt`` or ``yum`` or other
interfaces to your package management system.

For your convenience, we recommend that you install the |percona-release| utility
which makes it easy to install any |percona| product on your system.

You may also build and install |pbm| from source code in case you require a
fully controlled installation method.

Regardless of the installation method you choose, the following tools are at
your disposal after the installation completes:

===============  ===============================================================
Tool             Purpose
===============  ===============================================================
pbm              Command-line interface for controlling the backup system
pbm-agent        An agent for running backup/restore actions on a database host
===============  ===============================================================

You should install |pbm-agent| on every server that has mongod nodes in the
MongoDB cluster (or non-sharded replica set). The |pbm.app| CLI can be installed
on any or all servers or desktop computers you wish to use it from, so long as
those computers aren't network-blocked from accessing the MongoDB cluster.

Prerequisites
================================================================================

It is recommended to install |pbm| from official |percona| repositories by using
the |percona-release| utility.

|pbm| is available for installation from your package management system when you
enable the *tools* repository.

Installing |pbm| Using ``apt``
================================================================================

|percona| provides packages for the following systems that use the
:program:`apt` to interface the package management system:

* Debian 8 ("jessie")
* Debian 9 ("stretch")
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)

:program:`yum` to interface the package management system:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS 6 (current stable release)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS 7 (current stable release)

.. code-block:: bash

   $ yum update
   $ yum install percona-backup-mongodb

Building from source code
================================================================================

Building the project requires:

- Go 1.11 or above
- make

To build the project (from the project dir):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ go get -d github.com/percona/percona-backup-mongodb
   $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/percona/percona-backup-mongodb
   $ make

|pbm| services and location of configuration files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After |pbm| is successfully installed on your system, you have |pbm.app|
and |pbm-agent| programs on your system.

.. _pbm.installation.service_init_scripts:

Configuring service init scripts
================================================================================

The MongoDB connection URI string to the local mongod node should be set in
environment file that the `pbm-agent.service` systemd unit file includes.

With the current systemd unit file (see below) this means setting the 
"PBM_MONGODB_URI" environment variable in /etc/default/pbm-agent.

`.../systemd/system/pbm-agent.service`

.. include:: .res/code-block/bash/systemd-unit-file.txt

(See :ref:`pbm.auth` for an explanation of standard MongoDB connection strings
if you need.)
