|pbm.app| commands
**********************************************************************

``pbm CLI`` is the command line utility to control the backup system. This page describes |pbm.app| commands available in |PBM|.

For how to get started with |PBM|, see :ref:`initial-setup`.

.. _help:

.. rubric:: pbm help

Returns the help information about |pbm.app| commands.

.. _config:

.. rubric:: pbm config

Sets, changes or lists |PBM| configuration.

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm config [<flags>] [<key>]

The command accepts the following flags:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Flag
     - Description
   * - ``--force-resync``
     - Resync backup list with the current storage
   * - ``--list``
     - List current settings
   * - ``--file=FILE`` 
     - Upload the config information from a YAML file
   * - ``--set=SET``
     - Set a new config option value. Specify the option in the <key.name=value> format.
   
.. _backup:

.. rubric:: pbm backup

Creates a backup snapshot and saves it in the remote backup storage. 

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm backup [<flags>]

For more information about using ``pbm backup``, see :ref:`pbm.running.backup.starting` 

The command accepts the following flags:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Flag
     - Description
   * - ``--compression``
     - Create a backup with compression. 
       Supported compression methods: ``gzip``, ``snappy``, ``lz4``, ``s2``, ``pgzip``. Default: ``s2``
       The ``none`` value means no compression is done during backup.

.. _restore:

.. rubric:: pbm restore

Restores database from a specified backup / to a specified point in time. 

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm restore [<flags>] [<backup_name>]

For more information about using ``pbm restore``, see :ref:`pbm.running.backup.restoring`.

The command accepts the following flags:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Flag
     - Description
   * - ``--time=TIME``
     - Restores the database to the specified point in time. Available if :ref:`PITR` is enabled.
   * - ``--base-snapshot``
     - Restores the database from a specified backup to the specified point in time. Without this flag, the most recent backup preceding the timestamp is used for point in recovery. Available in |PBM| starting from version 1.6.0.
       
.. _cancel:       

.. rubric:: pbm cancel-backup

Cancels a running backup. The backup is marked as canceled in the backup list.

.. _list:

.. rubric:: pbm list

Provides the list of backups. In versions 1.3.4 and earlier, the command lists all backups and their states. Backup states are the following:

- In progress - A backup is running
- Canceled - A backup was canceled
- Error - A backup was finished with an error
- No status means a backup is complete

As of version 1.4.0, only successfully completed backups are listed. To view currently running backup information, run :ref:`status`.
  
When :ref:`PITR` is enabled, the ``pbm list`` also provides the list of valid time ranges for recovery and point-in-time recovery status. 

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm list [<flags>]

The command accepts the following flags:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   :align: right

   * - Flag
     - Description
   * - ``--restore``
     - Shows last N restores.
   * - ``--size=0``
     - Shows last N backups.

.. _delete:

.. rubric:: pbm delete-backup

Deletes the specified backup snapshot or all backup snapshots that are older than the specified time. The command deletes backups that are not running regardless of the remote backup storage being used.

The following is the command syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm delete-backup [<flags>] [<name>]

The command accepts the following flags:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Flag
     - Description
   * - ``--older-than=TIMESTAMP``
     - Deletes backups older than date / time specified in the format:
     
       - ``%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S`` (e.g. 2020-04-20T13:13:20) or 
       - ``%Y-%M-%D`` (e.g. 2020-04-20)
   * - ``--force``
     - Forcibly deletes backups without asking for user's confirmation   

.. _delete-pitr:

.. rubric:: pbm delete-pitr

Deletes :term:`oplog slices <Oplog slice>` produced for :ref:`pitr`. 

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm delete-pitr [<flags>] 

The command accepts the following flags:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Flag
     - Description
   * - ``-a``, ``--all``
     - Deletes all oplog slices
   * - ``--older-than=TIMESTAMP``
     - Deletes oplog slices older than date / time specified in the format:
     
       - ``%Y-%M-%DT%H:%M:%S`` (e.g. 2020-04-20T13:13:20) or 
       - ``%Y-%M-%D`` (e.g. 2020-04-20)
    
       When you specify a timestamp, |PBM| rounds it down to align with the completion time of the closest backup snapshot and deletes oplog slices that precede this time. Thus, extra slices remain. This is done to ensure oplog continuity. To illustrate, the PITR time range is ``2021-08-11T11:16:21 - 2021-08-12T08:55:25`` and backup snapshots are:

       .. code-block:: text

          2021-08-12T08:49:46Z 13.49MB [complete: 2021-08-12T08:50:06]
          2021-08-11T11:36:17Z 7.37MB [complete: 2021-08-11T11:36:38] 

       Say you specify the timestamp ``2021-08-11T19:16:21``. The closest backup is ``2021-08-11T11:36:17Z 7.37KB [complete: 2021-08-11T11:36:38]``. PBM rounds down the timestamp to ``2021-08-11T11:36:38`` and deletes all slices that precede this time. As a result, your PITR time range is ``2021-08-11T11:36:38 - 2021-08-12T09:00:25``.

       .. note::

          |PBM| doesn't delete the oplog slices that follow the most recent backup. This is done to ensure point in time recovery from that backup snapshot. For example, if the snapshot is ``2021-07-20T07:05:23Z [complete: 2021-07-21T07:05:44]`` and you specify the timestamp ``2021-07-20T07:05:45``, |PBM| deletes only slices that were made before ``2021-07-20T07:05:23Z``.

   * - ``--force``
     - Forcibly deletes oplog slices without asking a user's confirmation
   * - ``-o``, ``--out=json``
     - Shows the output as either the plain text (default) or a JSON object. Supported values: ``text``, ``json``.
