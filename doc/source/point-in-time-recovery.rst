Point-in-Time Recovery
********************************************************************************

|PITR| is restoring a database up to a specific moment. |PITR| includes restoring the data from a backup snapshot and replaying all events that occurred to this data up to a specified moment from :term:`oplog slices <Oplog slice>`. |PITR| helps you prevent data loss during a disaster such as crashed database, accidental data deletion or drop of tables, unwanted update of multiple fields instead of a single one.

|PITR| is available in |PBM| starting from v1.3.0. |PITR| is enabled via the ``pitr.enabled`` config option.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm config --set pitr.enabled=true

Incremental backups
================================================================================

When |PITR| is enabled, |pbm-agent| periodically saves consecutive slices of the :term:`oplog <Oplog>`. A method similar to the way replica set nodes elect a new primary is used to select the |pbm-agent| that saves the oplog slices. (Find more information in :ref:`pbm.architecture.agent`.)

By default, a slice covers a 10 minute span of oplog events. It can be shorter if |PITR| is disabled or interrupted by the start of a backup snapshot operation.

As of version 1.6.0, you can change the duration of an oplog span via the configuration file. Specify the new value (in minutes) for the ``pitr.oplogSpanMin`` option.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm config --set pitr.oplogSpanMin=5

If you set the new duration when the |pbm-agent| is making an oplog slice, the sliceâ€™s span is updated right away.  

If the new duration is shorter, this triggers the |pbm-agent| to make a new slice with the updated span immediately. If the new duration is larger,  the |pbm-agent| makes the next slice with the updated span in its scheduled time.

The oplog slices are stored in the :file:`pbmPitr` subdirectory in the :ref:`remote storage defined in the config <storage.config>`. A slice name reflects the start and end time this slice covers. 

The |pbm-list| output includes the following information:

- Backup snapshots. As of version 1.4.0, it also shows the completion time
- Valid time ranges for recovery
- |PITR| status.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm list

   Backup snapshots:
  	2020-12-10T12:19:10Z [complete: 2020-12-10T12:23:50]
  	2020-12-14T10:44:44Z [complete: 2020-12-14T10:49:03]
  	2020-12-14T14:26:20Z [complete: 2020-12-14T14:34:39]
  	2020-12-17T16:46:59Z [complete: 2020-12-17T16:51:07]
   PITR <on>:
  	2020-12-14T14:26:40 - 2020-12-16T17:27:26
  	2020-12-17T16:47:20 - 2020-12-17T16:57:55

.. note::

   If you just enabled |PITR|, the time range list in the ``pbm list`` output is empty. It requires 10 minutes for the first chunk to appear in the list.  

Restore to the point in time
============================

A restore and |PITR| incremental backups are incompatible operations and cannot be run simultaneously. You must disable |PITR| before restoring a database:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pbm config --set pitr.enabled=false

Run |pbm-restore| and specify the timestamp from the valid range:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm restore --time="2020-07-14T14:27:04"

Restoring to the point in time requires both a backup snapshot and oplog slices that can be replayed on top of it (the time ranges in PITR section of ``pbm list`` output must be later then the selected backup snapshot). 

.. seealso::

   :ref:`pbm.running.backup.restoring`.

A restore operation changes the time line of oplog events. Therefore, all oplog slices made after the restore time stamp and before the last backup become invalid. After the restore is complete, make a new backup to serve as the starting point for oplog updates: 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm backup

Re-enable |PITR| to resume saving oplog slices:  

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pbm config --set pitr.enabled=true


.. rubric:: Delete a backup

When you :ref:`delete a backup <pbm.backup.delete>`, all oplog slices that relate to this backup will be deleted too. For example, you delete a backup snapshot 2020-07-24T18:13:09 while there is another snapshot
2020-08-05T04:27:55 created after it.  |pbm-agent| deletes only oplog slices that relate to 2020-07-24T18:13:09.

The same applies if you delete backups older than the specified time.

.. note::

   When |PITR| is enabled, the most recent backup snapshot and oplog slices that relate to it won't be deleted.
