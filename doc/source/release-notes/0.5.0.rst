|pbm| |release|
********************************************************************************

|percona| is glad to announce the release of |pbm| 0.5.0 on |date|.

|pbm| is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of |mongodb|
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent
backups across a |mongodb| sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for
restoring those backups to a specific point in time. |pbm|
uses a distributed client/server architecture to perform backup/restore
actions.

The project was inspired by (and intends to replace) the
Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup tool.

|pbm| supports |psmdb| or |mongodb| Community Server version 3.6 or higher with
|mongodb| replication enabled. Binaries for the supported platforms as well as
the tarball with source code are available from the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/percona/percona-backup-mongodb/releases/tag/v0.5.0). For
more information about |pbm| and the installation steps,
see the `documentation <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb>`_.

|pbm| |release| features the following:

- Enables storing backup metadata on |amazon-s3| storages.
- The API of |pbm| introduces HTTP basic authentication to prevent an unauthorized user from
  running backups or restoring data if they manage to access the API port.
- To optimize the usage of network resources, the pbm-agent on ``mongos`` is not
  needed any more and |backup-coordinator| automatically establishes connection
  to the appropriate ``mongos`` instance.
- The output of ``pbmctl list nodes`` now includes the replica set name and
  informs the backup status of the node.

Note that |percona| doesn’t recommend this release for production, and its API
and configuration fields are likely to change in the future. It only features
a basic API level security. You are welcome to report any bugs you encounter in
`our bug tracking system <https://jira.percona.com>`_.
