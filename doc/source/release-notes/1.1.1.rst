.. _PBM-1.1.0:

|pbm| |release|
********************************************************************************

:Date: |date|
:Installation Instructions: :ref:`pbm.installation`
​
|pbm| is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of |mongodb|
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent
backups across a |mongodb| sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for
restoring those backups to a specific point in time. The project was inspired by
(and intends to replace) the Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup tool.

|pbm| supports `Percona Server for MongoDB
<https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb>`_
or `MongoDB Community Server
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community>`_ version 3.6 or higher with
`MongoDB replication <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/>`_
enabled. Binaries for the supported platforms as well as the tarball with source
code are available from the `Percona Backup for MongoDB download page
<https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-backup-mongodb/>`_. For more
information about |pbm| and the installation steps, see the :ref:`documentation
<pbm.index>`.
