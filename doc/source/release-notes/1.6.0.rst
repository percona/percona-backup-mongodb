:Installation: `Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/installation.html>`_

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

Release highlights:

- Support for Percona Server for MongoDB and MongoDB Community 5.0
- Point-in-time recovery enhancements: ability to restore from any previous snapshot and configurable span of oplog events
- JSON output for PBM commands to simplify interfacing PBM with applications
